  <li><a name="anch1" id="anch1"></a><strong> Coursistant  App stopped working, why?</strong>
    <p>Coursera, Udacity and other MOOC providers are  growing fast and are constantly searching for the best way to deliver  educational content to their community. So the technological environment for  the Coursistant App is changing rapidly which may result in the App not being  up to date and behaving unexpectedly. <br />
Our team is aiming the Coursitant App to be the  best tool for mobile learning and update and improve the App constantly, so  before you feel disappointed, please, try to share your experience with us at  Facebook support page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coursistant">We are pleased to receive any message and  answer always.</a>. We are pleased to receive any message and  answer always.</p></li>

  <li><strong><a name="anch2" id="anch2"></a></strong><strong>NO SOUND! A video stream is available but the sound is  absent. Any solution? </strong>
    <p><strong> </strong>We have recently discovered that it could be an iPad feature, as we are  using the basic media player with no special tweaks and hacks. Look at the  following video to find the solution: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDf1LDcE95Q">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDf1LDcE95Q</a><br/></p>

  <li><strong><a name="anch3" id="anch3"></a></strong><strong>Why  Coursera video lectures are not available for download in my course?</strong>
    <p>In  this case try to check if video lectures for your course are allowed to be  downloaded by Coursera itself.  This is the example reference from the &ldquo;Social Psychology&rdquo; course:<br />
      <em>Q: Can I download copies of the videos?</em> <br />
      <em>A: In order to include various copyrighted  material shown in the videos, Professor Plous often had to pledge to the  rightsholders that the videos would only be posted for registered students to  view in the course's password protected area. Any unauthorized duplication or  distribution of the videos would violate this pledge and could lead the  copyright holders to remove their material from the course, so for the good of  all, we ask that you not download any course videos.</em></p>

  <li><strong id="anch4" name="anch4"><a name="anch4" id="anch4"></a></strong><strong>How  to use &ldquo;Archived&rdquo; switch?</strong>
    <p>Archived  state is used when, for example, you have many &ldquo;Current&rdquo; courses and some of  them should be hidden from  the regular use. In this case you can move it to the &ldquo;Archived&rdquo; category so  they don&rsquo;t clutter with the &ldquo;Current&rdquo; category screen (this is especially  important for Udacity as all their courses are considered to be &ldquo;Current&rdquo;). You  can return them to the &ldquo;Current&rdquo; category, but you need to find them in the  &ldquo;Archive&rdquo; screen and switch off &quot;Archived&quot; state in the course detail  screen.<br />
      However,  Coursera courses which have passed (closed)   and directed to the &ldquo;Archived&rdquo; category automatically, and you can&rsquo;t  make them &ldquo;Current&rdquo; - as they are not currently available for learning from the  Coursera web-site.</p>
  </li>

  <li><strong id="anch5" name="anch5"><a name="anch5" id="anch5"></a>I&rsquo;m  singned in to Udacity, but where are my courses?</strong>
  <p>We  have recently discovered, that it is necessary to complete at least one quiz to  link a Udacity course to a user profile. See the following discussion link for  details: <a href="http://forums.udacity.com/questions/100109139/problem-with-joining-a-class">http://forums.udacity.com/questions/100109139/problem-with-joining-a-class</a><br />
    The summary is here:<br />
  <em>&quot;</em>Udacity has implemented a new enrollment process. When a prospective  student wants to enroll in a class, they merely go to the course catalog, click  on the course, view it, and at the end of the &quot;view&quot; a short quiz is  available. The prospective student merely needs to take (and pass) the quiz,  and then the option to enroll will become available to them.<em>&quot;</em></p>

    <p>Connect your iOS device to your computer using the included Dock Connector to USB cable. Launch iTunes 9.1 or later on your computer. Select your iOS device from the Devices section of iTunes. Click the Apps tab and scroll down to the bottom of the page to find Coursistant app. Select the Coursera or Udacity course folder and click Save To..</p>

    <li><strong id="anch7" name="anch7"><a name="anch7" id="anch7"></a></strong><strong>What is better online or offline mode?</strong>
    <p>By downloading videos and watching them offline in Coursistant iPad app you can reduce the load on Coursera and Udacity servers and thus costs, so they can deliver more great content for you for free. In addition app itself will run faster. So we recommend to download all you need, switch to offline and enjoy</p>
